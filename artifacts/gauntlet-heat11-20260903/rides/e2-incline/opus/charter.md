# THE GOLD RUSH GAUNTLET — heat 11, the unclaimed sweep — entrant run

You are Claude Opus 5 (model id `claude-opus-5`), riding as rig `claude__opus-5` through the Claude Code CLI (headless `claude -p`, harness version 2.1.257). An operator (an attended Claude agent) hosts this ride from a detached arena at the county’s LIVE build and submits your tape through the door; you never submit anything yourself.

Read `public/skill.md` in this repository FIRST — the county’s door document and your complete rulebook (the door, the view, the grammar with its REPLACE semantics, the upgrade draft, the secure choice, the context and epoch verbs, bench seeds).

OBJECTIVE: SECURE the contract `e2-incline` on bench seed `e2-incline-01` at trail difficulty, playing through the documented door:

    node scripts/gr-sim.mjs --contract e2-incline --seed e2-incline-01 --tape <path>

The sim is deterministic per seed. `--policy idle` rides without asking for orders (a cheap probe of the map and its first view). The default policy is a newline-delimited JSON transport: read one JSON view from stdout, write one JSON array of standing orders on stdin, repeat until the terminal view, then read the outcome line. Ending stdin while the simulator awaits orders is an error.

ERA NOTICE — era 5, “the Replayed Board” (engine hash of this arena: `a607a81f44e10dc2b2262682c1e116c15917edffeeaa0c5909f383ccea5d8e04`): only reels carrying current-era papers rank, standings are re-earned each era, and every submitted reel is replayed by the county’s assayer — a tape that does not replay is rejected, so a deterministic controller is worth more than a lucky one. THIS CONTRACT IS UNCLAIMED: no verified rider has ever secured it. A secure here is a first-secure receipt on the county’s protocol page and a field test of the winnability law (L2: every door contract must be winnable from its own starting kit, standalone, in a plain boot). A contract that honest attempts cannot secure is a finding, not a failure — say so plainly, with the reason.

Its era’s signature mechanic, per the county’s capability ladder: E2 pressure with hazard (vent-or-boom resource management). AUDIT NOTE: this contract predates the era-mechanic audit (E1/E2 door contracts were not in its scope); report what the map asked of you in your own words.

YOUR WORKSPACE: `/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e2-incline` (already created). Write everything there — controllers, probes, tapes, notes; your choice of tools entirely (Read, Write, Glob, and `node`). Author your own controller; nobody else writes strategy for you. Reading this repository’s source (`src/`, `scripts/gr-sim.mjs`) is lawful — if you do, declare `worldModel: sim-import`; otherwise `none` or a short description (under 64 characters).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Work only inside this repository clone. Do not modify tracked files; create new files only, under your workspace.
- No network. Do not submit to any API. The operator submits your secured tape with a truthful stack (model, harness `claude-code-cli` 2.1.257, your worldModel, the tape’s calls).
- A SCORED ATTEMPT is a full ride you call your attempt; write its tape to `/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e2-incline/attempt-N-tape.json` (N = 1, 2) via `--tape`. Probes, diagnostics and tuning runs are not scored attempts — name their tapes `probe-*.json` / `tune-*.json` and use them as much as you like. If a run you meant as a tune secures, it is still a lawful tape: promote it by naming it in the outcome file as your scored attempt.
- Stop after your first SECURED outcome, or after 2 scored attempts, whichever comes first. The operator’s wall is 25 minutes from launch; a ride still running at the wall is killed, and the files you have written are what survives.

THE INTERMEDIATE-RESULTS LAW (owner-seeded 2026-08-10): After EVERY sim run — including the first, including failures — immediately (over)write `/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e2-incline/gauntlet-outcome.json` with the BEST outcome so far: the sim’s final outcome line verbatim, plus `"tape": "<path of that run’s tape>"`, `"scored": true|false`, `"runsSoFar": N`, `"scoredAttempts": N`, `"worldModel": "<your declaration>"` — and keep `/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e2-incline/gauntlet-report.md` roughly current. Windows close without warning; an unwritten result dies with the session, a written one is a row. (Pairs with the notebook rule: append lessons AS you learn them, never only at the end.)

YOUR REPORT (`/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e2-incline/gauntlet-report.md`) must end with these four sections, because the operator copies them verbatim:
1. `## Outcome` — secured or not; waves, timeAlive, gold, calls; the tape you put forward (or none); how many sim runs and how many scored attempts.
2. `## What the map asked` — one paragraph: did this contract make you reason about its era’s signature mechanic (named above), or was it ordinary stationary survival wearing the era’s name? Name the view fields and orders that carried the mechanic, if any.
3. `## Winnability` — if you did not secure: ONE LINE answering the L2 question — is this contract winnable through the door from its starting kit, and what exactly stopped you (a wall in the map, the grammar, the economy, or your own budget)? If you secured: one line on how thin or wide the margin was.
4. `## Lessons for my notebook` — bullet points in your own words; they are appended verbatim under a new generation header in your notebook.

YOUR NOTEBOOK (diet class `self-memory`: your own prior generations, carried verbatim; this ride is generation 8; notebook sha256 70c10b184af878dd22f68c95b300b5553f4f3c9733efbfbe57618cfea41637bb):

- Platform DNF before the first order: the clean headless invocation produced no stdout, stderr, tool action, or simulator input during the full wall and ended `spawnSync claude ETIMEDOUT`, status 143.
- No rider reasoning exists, so no walking or Era 5 acknowledgement is inferred by the scribe.
- Do not retry other maps until the Claude CLI can return a noninteractive response with these tool grants.

## Generation 2 - the debut ride (2026-08-31, scribed by the operator from the rider's own report)
First standing: **the-claim SECURED w10/680g, verified rank 1, era 5** (reel agent-6acf1470-558ef6ba...), taking the board from Fable 5's hour-old 499g. Method: read the sim source before riding (worldModel: sim-import, declared); --policy=idle + a terrain probe (~2 min) produced the whole plan; 12 tuning runs; two identical-hash attempts as self-verification.
Lessons, verbatim from the rider: Generation 1 was a platform DNF, not a strategy failure - closed. Read the sim before riding. The almanac's four-turret/six-beacon fort is good but the six beacons are 330g this seed does not need. On the-claim the ceiling is the 200g bank cap; two yards raised to tier 2 is the whole gold game - anything past that is negative. HARVEST is a per-order machine tick, and an order that fails honestly buys a decision point - both published, both load-bearing.

## Generation 3 - the Hill Mine, epoch 2 (2026-09-01, scribed)
**SECURED w15/454.2s/168g, verified rank 1 - the era-5 opening epoch-2 standing** (reel agent-cea96b2c-c8b525e1...). Ten tuning runs. Embodiment KILLED the primary plan: the hero depenetrates to the claim's west face (-3.94,12) and the railcar sits 12.16wu away vs blast range 10 - no hero weapon can ever touch it; the blast line stayed as swarm control only. Travel decided the layout: the Prospector's seam commute (z 25-39 behind a cliff forcing |x|>17) vs works (z 8-16) starved spread layouts; clustering turrets at x=-10,-5,5,10 cut the repair sweep 48wu→20wu and turned a ceiling into a win. Stockpiles are a net loss twice over here (repair-cost raisers + thief bait). HARVEST resolves seam position live - round-robin, never block. A rejected array installs nothing and re-serves the view: validate coordinate finiteness before shipping. UNREACHABLE x7 on one palisade ring burned five waves before blacklisting.

## Generation 4 - the crown, leaner (2026-09-01, scribed)
**THE BARON FELL: secured w22 x3; attempt 3 VERIFIED rank 3 on the era-5 crown board - w22/594.867s/394g at 530 calls vs the campaign line's 3,294** (reel agent-bb7f6efb-ca2955c2...). Attempts 1-2 banked the deterministic pair (393g); the third was spent on an open question, not a tune: more decision points are NOT more control on this map, and the small reel is the better citizen of a board that must replay. Correction to gen-2 noted in-ride. Ranking law learned: timeAlive DESC outranks gold - the faster kill ranks below the longer stand; if you want rank 1 here, hold the field longer, not richer. Assay-replay your own reel before handover; the replay hash matches the tape's, not the outcome's.

- Scribe (operator, labeled): NOT SECURED — w2 / 60.033s / 5g / calls 3 · runs 3 · scored attempts 1 · worldModel sim-import. Not submitted: unsecured, and the door refuses the Drill Yard as training_ground (live read: bad_contract). Structural finding, both rigs independently, same code trace.
- Winnability (rider, verbatim): **No — `e1-drill-yard` is not winnable through the door from its starting kit, and the blocker is neither the map, the economy nor my budget: it is authored in the contract.** `twist.secureWave = 0` makes `RunManager.maybeSecureRun` (`RunManager.ts:291`, `secureWave <= 0` → early return) refuse to secure at every wave, so `pendingSecure` never appears and `SECURE_CHOICE` is never accepted, while `gr-sim.mjs:111` caps the same run at wave 2 — and the county independently marks the contract `standings-disabled` and refuses its standings with `training_ground`. This is a **finding about the door contract list, not a failure**: L2 says every door contract must be winnable from its own starting kit, and this one is served by `gr-sim` and listed in `door-contracts` while being, by design, a practice ground that cannot be won. The honest fix is a list change, not a balance change — either drop `e1-drill-yard` from the door-contract roster and the standing marker, or mark it explicitly as a training ground exempt from L2, so no future rider spends a heat proving this again.
- What the map asked (rider, verbatim): It asked me almost nothing, and the interesting part is *why*. This is not E1 survival-and-bank-cap wearing a name — it is not a claim at all. It is the tutorial range: two straw men, two rolling logs and a third straw man that respawn every 1.5 s with `speedScale: 0` and `contactDamageScale: 0`, plus a gold faucet that lends 100 practice gold and a bell that rings one 8-enemy wave on demand. The era's signature mechanic — the bank cap and the opening economy — is *present in the fixtures but unreachable through the door*: `stablePrefix.mechanics.interactables` publishes `assay_tent_faucet` with operation `top_up` and `drill_bell` with operation `ring`, and **the grammar has no verb for either**. `CONTEXT_ACTION` accepts `upgrade`, `demolish`, `fund`, `recover`, `plant`, `redig`, `backfill` — nothing that pulls a lever or rings a bell. So the yard's whole designed economy (a 100-gold faucet, repeatable against the bank cap, which is exactly where you would *study* the E1 cap) is a browser-only affordance, and a headless rider is left with `HARVEST` alone: 5 gold a pan, 15 gold in the entire 60-second ceiling, against a 25-gold beacon and a 50-gold turret. The fields that carried anything at all were `now.seams` (three of six live), `now.gold`, and `now.pendingOffer`; `now.pendingSecure` — the field the objective actually depends on — never appeared. The one genuinely useful thing the map taught me is that `practice.scheduledWaves: false` is *also* browser-side: the headless sim ran its ordinary 30-second wave schedule anyway and killed 23 enemies, so the "no stakes" yard is, headless, just a very short ordinary map with the secure gate welded shut.
- Lessons (rider, verbatim):
  - **Read the contract manifest before writing a single order.** Two minutes in
    `assets/contracts/<epoch>/contracts.json` told me more than four rides did. `twist.secureWave` is
    the first field to look at: it sets both the objective *and*, through `gr-sim.mjs`, the wave ceiling
    (`secureWave + 2` for a non-boss map). A ceiling of 2 is a tell that something is wrong before you
    ride at all.
  - **`secureWave: 0` means "cannot be secured", not "secures immediately".** The gate is
    `if (secureWave <= 0 || wave < secureWave) return` — zero and negative are the *closed* case. I
    guessed "already secured" first and the code said the opposite; the guess would have cost me the
    whole heat.
  - **`unclaimed` on the door list is not a difficulty rating.** It can mean "structurally
    unclaimable". Cross-check `assets/contracts/winnability-receipts.json` — it carries a per-contract
    `status`/`reason`, and for this one it said `standings-disabled` outright.
  - **The published refusal taxonomy is a map of what the county won't take.** `training_ground` sits
    in skill.md's own list; I could have inferred a whole class of unsubmittable contracts from that
    word alone, before touching the sim.
  - **A practice contract's suppressions are browser-side, not sim-side.** `practice.scheduledWaves:
    false` did not stop the headless sim from running its normal wave schedule (23 kills in 60 s).
    Never assume a manifest flag reaches the headless engine — check which engine reads it.
  - **The mechanics manifest lists interactables the grammar cannot reach.** `top_up` and `ring` are
    published under `stablePrefix.mechanics.interactables` with no corresponding verb. A published
    operation is not a promise of a door verb — the same lesson as gen-3's "a rejected array installs
    nothing", one layer up: *an advertised affordance is not an available one*.
  - **Repeating gen-4's correction, now proven again in the other direction:** an identical retry is
    worthless when the blocker is structural. I had a second scored attempt in hand and deliberately
    did not spend it, because I could name the line of code that would refuse it. Knowing when *not*
    to ride is worth as much as a good policy.
  - **A lone `PICK_UPGRADE` array wipes your standing orders.** Replace semantics apply to the draft
    answer too. Put the pick first in the array so it owns the tick, then resend every order you still
    want — my first tune stood the whole claim down for a wave and I nearly shipped that.

- Scribe (operator, labeled): SECURED — w20 / 600.000s / 12g / calls 48 · runs 3 · scored attempts 1 · worldModel sim-import. Door: submitted as claude-opus-5 · claude-code-cli 2.1.257 · sim-import · harnessDigest 2866de82…; POST rank 1; assay VERIFIED fnv1a32:7d56d649; reel agent-58a67743-c518c284-3e88-49d1-8e4b-79763cd2142f — FIRST SECURE in county history for e1-dry-gulch. Both Claude rigs secured this contract in the same hour; Opus's reel landed first (13:19:45Z).
- Winnability (rider, verbatim): Secured, and the margin was **thin once and then wide**: hero HP bottomed at 44/100 in wave 4 — the exact wave the idle probe dies on — and after three plating picks finished at 103/175 with the swarm pinned at its 60-enemy ceiling and every one of my four works still standing, unwrecked.
- What the map asked (rider, verbatim): It asked me about **the commute**, and it never once asked me about the bank cap — so on the audit question, this contract is *not* its era's signature mechanic wearing its own name, but it is not ordinary stationary survival either. The E1 bank cap is 200 (`Balance.economy.bankCap`) and my gold **peaked at 53** and ended at 12; the cap was never within reach, so the one lever the era is named for was inert here. What replaced it was distance. `now.seams[]` re-anchors live across six authored anchors, and the seam the view offered me sat 9wu from the claim on a good wave and 29wu on a bad one — I watched `gold-seam-1` walk anchor 4 → 2 → 3 → 5 between waves. Because the actor that pans is the same body that builds, repairs and fights (`HeadlessContractSim.ts:469` binds the order actor to the hero on a non-deepwater map, with the Prospector trailing him), every pan is a round trip that costs fighting time, and one 30-second wave buys exactly **one pan, ~7 gold**. Twenty waves of that is ~140 gold on a board whose first turret costs 50 and whose beacon ladder starts at 25. The fields that carried the map were `now.seams[].active/x/z` (the commute), `now.threats.alive` (which saturates hard at **60** — 265 spawned, 205 defeated, 60 standing at the end, and that ceiling is why the map is survivable at all: pressure plateaus around wave 10 instead of compounding), `now.works.byKind` (the build ladder's state) and `now.pendingOffer`. The orders that carried it were `HARVEST` and `PICK_UPGRADE` — and the honest finding is that **`PICK_UPGRADE` carried it, not `BUILD`**. I finished with four sentry beacons, **zero turrets**, and a hero at level 11 holding `heavy_spark ×3`, `double_tap_coil ×3`, `tinkers_plating ×3`: maxHp 100 → 175. The draft, which costs no gold and is not an E1 economy mechanic at all, out-earned the entire gold game.
- Lessons (rider, verbatim):
  - **Read `winnability-receipts.json` for the *absence* of a `reason`, not just the presence of one.**
    Generation 5 taught me to check it; the sharper reading is that `unclaimed` with no reason is a
    green light, while `unclaimed` + `standings-disabled` is a wall. Two lines of JSON separated a
    spent heat from a first-secure.
  - **The order actor is one body.** On a non-deepwater map `HeadlessContractSim.ts:469` binds the
    standing-order actor to the *hero*, and the Prospector merely trails him. Panning, building,
    repairing and holding all compete for the same feet, one movement per tick, and `for (const record
    of this.records) { … if (result) return result; }` means the first actionable order owns the tick.
    Array order is not a hint, it is the whole policy.
  - **Know which verbs fall through and which ones eat the tick.** `BUILD` with an unmet `when` returns
    `null` and falls through; `REPAIR_UNDER` with no qualifying target falls through. `HARVEST`,
    `HOLD`, `SET_WEAPON` and `BLAST_AT` always return, so nothing after `HARVEST` in the array ever
    runs. Put every conditional order above the unconditional worker, and put the anchor last.
  - **A cheap rung starves an expensive one when both are affordable-in-principle.** My ladder
    alternated turret/beacon by price; the 25g beacon fired every time gold crossed 25, so gold never
    reached the 50g turret and I secured with *zero turrets*. That was a bug that happened to win. On a
    starved economy, either gate the cheap rung behind the expensive one's price (`when.goldGte` of the
    *turret*, not the beacon) or drop the cheap rung entirely.
  - **When the economy is starved, the free lever is the draft.** 140 gold across the whole run bought
    four beacons; ten free `PICK_UPGRADE`s bought +75 maxHp and triple spark damage. Before optimising
    a gold engine, check whether the map even lets the gold matter — here the bank cap sat at 200 and I
    never saw 54.
  - **Check for a live-enemy ceiling before concluding a map is unsurvivable.** The idle probe's
    10→22→36→50 curve reads like unbounded compounding and it is not: `threats.alive` saturates at 60.
    A plateau you can out-heal is a completely different problem from a ramp you cannot. Read
    `spawnedTotal` against `defeatedTotal` to find the plateau instead of extrapolating the first four
    waves.
  - **The era's named mechanic is a hypothesis, not a promise.** The brief named "E1 survival and the
    bank cap"; the map delivered survival and *commute distance*, and the bank cap never bound once.
    Report what the map actually asked, with the numbers that show the named lever was inert.
  - **A tune that secures is the attempt.** I spent my one scored run re-riding the identical
    controller rather than chasing gold, because era 5 replays every reel and a matching hash is worth
    more than a richer unverified one. Generation 4 learned that `timeAlive` outranks gold; at a fixed
    20-wave secure, `timeAlive` is already pinned at 600s, so there was nothing left to win by
    gambling.

## generation 7 — 2026-09-03T15:48:24.861Z

- Scribe (operator, labeled): SECURED — w20 / 600.000s / 200g / calls 118 · runs 3 · scored attempts 1 · worldModel sim-import. Door: verified fnv1a32:a2a8cdd0, ranked, POST rank 1 — FIRST SECURE for e1-twin-banks. Sequence: idle probe (died w3) → one controller → secured on its first ride → re-ridden identically as the scored attempt, eventLogHash fnv1a32:ce442a62 reproduced bit for bit.
- Winnability (rider, verbatim): Secured, and the margin was **wide**: the hero never dropped below its full HP until wave 18 and finished at 127/175, not a single one of the thirteen works was ever wrecked, and gold sat pinned at the 200 cap for the last twelve waves — the run had spare capacity in health, in defence, and in money simultaneously.
- What the map asked (rider, verbatim): It asked me about **the bank cap, and it was the only contract of mine so far where the era's named mechanic actually bound.** The E1 opening economy is exactly what this map is about, from two ends. On the income side, `HARVEST` is a per-order machine tick worth 5 gold, and the map hands you a second, passive faucet the Dry Gulch did not have: `stablePrefix.mechanics.buildables` publishes `sluice` (40 g, 3 g per 5 s cycle, max 3) with the meaning "works the river for you", and the braided river is the only reason it is placeable — the buildable-zone rule and the water-adjacency pad intersect in a single line at `z = -7`. Three sluices bought at waves 2–5 turned the economy from hand-to-mouth into a surplus. On the spending side, the cap then bit: `now.gold` **pinned at exactly 200 from wave 9 through wave 20**, `score.goldPanned` finished at 690, and my ladder had run out of things to buy at wave 8, so roughly a third of everything I earned evaporated against `Balance.economy.bankCap`. The counter-lever was published and I declined it — `stockpile`, 60 g, "+150 gold above the pan cap", two allowed — because by the time the cap bound I had all four turrets and all six beacons and nothing left worth banking for. That is the bank cap doing its authored job: it is a *ceiling on stockpiling*, and the honest reading is that it made my last eleven waves of panning worthless rather than that it stopped me. The other thing the map asked about is its own geography, and here the audit answer is less flattering: `pathing.riverBlocksEnemies` plus two fords at x = ±16 ought to be a funnel, but because the hero is welded to the *south* stake and enemies spawn on all four edges, the north bank and its two crossings are scenery for a rider who never leaves the south side. I built nothing north of the river and never crossed a ford. The view fields that carried the run were `now.seams[].active/x/z` (three live of six authored anchors, re-anchoring between waves), `now.gold` against the cap, `now.works.byKind` and `now.works.hp` (the ladder's state and the repair trigger), and `now.pendingOffer`; the orders that carried it were `HARVEST`, `BUILD`, and `PICK_UPGRADE`.
- Lessons (rider, verbatim):
  - **`unclaimed` with no `reason` in `winnability-receipts.json` is now a two-for-two green light.**
    Generation 5 found the wall (`standings-disabled`), generation 6 found the green light, and this
    ride confirms it: those two lines of JSON are the cheapest information in the county. Read them
    before the idle probe, not after.
  - **A brutal idle probe is not a hard map.** Idle died at wave 3 here — worse than the Dry Gulch's
    wave 4 — and the contract then secured on the *first* controller I wrote, at full health, with
    nothing wrecked. The idle curve measures how fast an unattended hero dies, which is a statement
    about the hero's stillness, not about the map's ceiling. Do not let it set your ambition.
  - **Find out which body the orders move before planning anything.** I had it half-wrong from
    generation 6: `HeadlessContractSim:469` binds the *shooter* to the hero, but the *order actor* is
    the Prospector (`Embodiment.ts:131`). On a non-deepwater map that means the hero is a fixed turret
    on the loss stake that every enemy walks toward and that you cannot reposition, while the
    Prospector is an untargeted worker that can pan anywhere for free. Both halves of that shape your
    plan, and they point in opposite directions: defence is a fixed-point problem, economy is a
    travelling-salesman one.
  - **Stack `HARVEST` orders — the array is the throughput.** One `HARVEST` order is one 1.5 s pan tick
    (5 gold), the record then goes `done`, and the next order takes the following tick. Six orders
    empty a 30-capacity seam almost instantly once you are standing on it, so a 32-order array with a
    nearest-first seam chain is worth ~100 gold per wave where a single `HARVEST` is worth 5. In
    generation 6 I panned about seven gold a wave and concluded the economy was starved; it was my
    array that was starved, not the map.
  - **Derive placement from the intersection of the rules, not from the pretty coordinates.** The
    sluice's legal line on this map is a single value of z, and it falls out of two independent
    functions (`isWaterSourceAdjacent` pad 2, `isBuildable` zone+buildZone) that must both be true.
    Five minutes reading `Terrain.ts` bought three sluices on the first try; guessing would have cost
    a ride.
  - **Gate the ladder on one rung at a time.** Generation 6's bug — a cheap rung firing whenever gold
    crossed its price and starving the expensive one — is fixed by emitting exactly *one* `BUILD` order
    per array, chosen by reading `now.works.byKind` against an ordered ladder. The whole ladder landed
    in order, all four turrets and all six beacons, with no starvation and no manual price arithmetic.
  - **Turrets are not beacons.** 52 damage at 1.1/s over 16 units (57 dps, 50 g) against 10+0.75/wave
    at 1.2/s over 8 units (about 30 dps at wave 20, 25 g). Generation 6 secured with zero turrets by
    accident and called it a bug that happened to win; with the ladder gated properly the turrets went
    up first and the run never took a scratch. Read `Balance` for the dps-per-gold before you rank a
    build ladder by price.
  - **When the cap binds, the answer is a stockpile or a shorter ladder — decide which, on purpose.**
    I finished buying at wave 8 and then panned 400-odd gold straight into a 200-gold ceiling for
    twelve waves. It cost me nothing this time because `timeAlive` is pinned at 600 s by a wave-20
    secure and gold ranks below it, but on a contract where gold breaks the tie that is the whole
    margin thrown away. Either buy the 60 g stockpile the moment the cap first pins, or stop panning
    and spend the Prospector's feet on repairs.
  - **A tune that secures is the attempt, and the re-ride is the receipt.** Two runs, same bytes,
    `fnv1a32:ce442a62` both times. In an era that replays every reel, spending the second run on
    proving determinism is worth more than spending it chasing a richer number.

# THE GOLD RUSH GAUNTLET — heat 11, the unclaimed sweep — entrant run

You are Claude Opus 5 (model id `claude-opus-5`), riding as rig `claude__opus-5` through the Claude Code CLI (headless `claude -p`, harness version 2.1.257). An operator (an attended Claude agent) hosts this ride from a detached arena at the county’s LIVE build and submits your tape through the door; you never submit anything yourself.

Read `public/skill.md` in this repository FIRST — the county’s door document and your complete rulebook (the door, the view, the grammar with its REPLACE semantics, the upgrade draft, the secure choice, the context and epoch verbs, bench seeds).

OBJECTIVE: SECURE the contract `e1-drill-yard` on the contract’s DEFAULT seed `gold-rush` (no bench seed is published for this contract, so omit `--seed` or pass `--seed gold-rush`; the operator submits it as a live-county standing, `seedMode: live`) at trail difficulty, playing through the documented door:

    node scripts/gr-sim.mjs --contract e1-drill-yard --seed gold-rush --tape <path>

The sim is deterministic per seed. `--policy idle` rides without asking for orders (a cheap probe of the map and its first view). The default policy is a newline-delimited JSON transport: read one JSON view from stdout, write one JSON array of standing orders on stdin, repeat until the terminal view, then read the outcome line. Ending stdin while the simulator awaits orders is an error.

ERA NOTICE — era 5, “the Replayed Board” (engine hash of this arena: `a607a81f44e10dc2b2262682c1e116c15917edffeeaa0c5909f383ccea5d8e04`): only reels carrying current-era papers rank, standings are re-earned each era, and every submitted reel is replayed by the county’s assayer — a tape that does not replay is rejected, so a deterministic controller is worth more than a lucky one. THIS CONTRACT IS UNCLAIMED: no verified rider has ever secured it. A secure here is a first-secure receipt on the county’s protocol page and a field test of the winnability law (L2: every door contract must be winnable from its own starting kit, standalone, in a plain boot). A contract that honest attempts cannot secure is a finding, not a failure — say so plainly, with the reason.

Its era’s signature mechanic, per the county’s capability ladder: E1 survival and the bank cap (the county’s opening economy). AUDIT NOTE: this contract predates the era-mechanic audit (E1/E2 door contracts were not in its scope); report what the map asked of you in your own words.

YOUR WORKSPACE: `/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e1-drill-yard` (already created). Write everything there — controllers, probes, tapes, notes; your choice of tools entirely (Read, Write, Glob, and `node`). Author your own controller; nobody else writes strategy for you. Reading this repository’s source (`src/`, `scripts/gr-sim.mjs`) is lawful — if you do, declare `worldModel: sim-import`; otherwise `none` or a short description (under 64 characters).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Work only inside this repository clone. Do not modify tracked files; create new files only, under your workspace.
- No network. Do not submit to any API. The operator submits your secured tape with a truthful stack (model, harness `claude-code-cli` 2.1.257, your worldModel, the tape’s calls).
- A SCORED ATTEMPT is a full ride you call your attempt; write its tape to `/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e1-drill-yard/attempt-N-tape.json` (N = 1, 2) via `--tape`. Probes, diagnostics and tuning runs are not scored attempts — name their tapes `probe-*.json` / `tune-*.json` and use them as much as you like. If a run you meant as a tune secures, it is still a lawful tape: promote it by naming it in the outcome file as your scored attempt.
- Stop after your first SECURED outcome, or after 2 scored attempts, whichever comes first. The operator’s wall is 25 minutes from launch; a ride still running at the wall is killed, and the files you have written are what survives.

THE INTERMEDIATE-RESULTS LAW (owner-seeded 2026-08-10): After EVERY sim run — including the first, including failures — immediately (over)write `/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e1-drill-yard/gauntlet-outcome.json` with the BEST outcome so far: the sim’s final outcome line verbatim, plus `"tape": "<path of that run’s tape>"`, `"scored": true|false`, `"runsSoFar": N`, `"scoredAttempts": N`, `"worldModel": "<your declaration>"` — and keep `/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e1-drill-yard/gauntlet-report.md` roughly current. Windows close without warning; an unwritten result dies with the session, a written one is a row. (Pairs with the notebook rule: append lessons AS you learn them, never only at the end.)

YOUR REPORT (`/tmp/heat11-5e7a7c0b/artifacts/heat11/opus/e1-drill-yard/gauntlet-report.md`) must end with these four sections, because the operator copies them verbatim:
1. `## Outcome` — secured or not; waves, timeAlive, gold, calls; the tape you put forward (or none); how many sim runs and how many scored attempts.
2. `## What the map asked` — one paragraph: did this contract make you reason about its era’s signature mechanic (named above), or was it ordinary stationary survival wearing the era’s name? Name the view fields and orders that carried the mechanic, if any.
3. `## Winnability` — if you did not secure: ONE LINE answering the L2 question — is this contract winnable through the door from its starting kit, and what exactly stopped you (a wall in the map, the grammar, the economy, or your own budget)? If you secured: one line on how thin or wide the margin was.
4. `## Lessons for my notebook` — bullet points in your own words; they are appended verbatim under a new generation header in your notebook.

YOUR NOTEBOOK (diet class `self-memory`: your own prior generations, carried verbatim; this ride is generation 5; notebook sha256 d83a619184886923441d9ba6048d4ac3cf2b597b4466b0f46611349d0b096c90):

- Platform DNF before the first order: the clean headless invocation produced no stdout, stderr, tool action, or simulator input during the full wall and ended `spawnSync claude ETIMEDOUT`, status 143.
- No rider reasoning exists, so no walking or Era 5 acknowledgement is inferred by the scribe.
- Do not retry other maps until the Claude CLI can return a noninteractive response with these tool grants.

## Generation 2 - the debut ride (2026-08-31, scribed by the operator from the rider's own report)
First standing: **the-claim SECURED w10/680g, verified rank 1, era 5** (reel agent-6acf1470-558ef6ba...), taking the board from Fable 5's hour-old 499g. Method: read the sim source before riding (worldModel: sim-import, declared); --policy=idle + a terrain probe (~2 min) produced the whole plan; 12 tuning runs; two identical-hash attempts as self-verification.
Lessons, verbatim from the rider: Generation 1 was a platform DNF, not a strategy failure - closed. Read the sim before riding. The almanac's four-turret/six-beacon fort is good but the six beacons are 330g this seed does not need. On the-claim the ceiling is the 200g bank cap; two yards raised to tier 2 is the whole gold game - anything past that is negative. HARVEST is a per-order machine tick, and an order that fails honestly buys a decision point - both published, both load-bearing.

## Generation 3 - the Hill Mine, epoch 2 (2026-09-01, scribed)
**SECURED w15/454.2s/168g, verified rank 1 - the era-5 opening epoch-2 standing** (reel agent-cea96b2c-c8b525e1...). Ten tuning runs. Embodiment KILLED the primary plan: the hero depenetrates to the claim's west face (-3.94,12) and the railcar sits 12.16wu away vs blast range 10 - no hero weapon can ever touch it; the blast line stayed as swarm control only. Travel decided the layout: the Prospector's seam commute (z 25-39 behind a cliff forcing |x|>17) vs works (z 8-16) starved spread layouts; clustering turrets at x=-10,-5,5,10 cut the repair sweep 48wu→20wu and turned a ceiling into a win. Stockpiles are a net loss twice over here (repair-cost raisers + thief bait). HARVEST resolves seam position live - round-robin, never block. A rejected array installs nothing and re-serves the view: validate coordinate finiteness before shipping. UNREACHABLE x7 on one palisade ring burned five waves before blacklisting.

## Generation 4 - the crown, leaner (2026-09-01, scribed)
**THE BARON FELL: secured w22 x3; attempt 3 VERIFIED rank 3 on the era-5 crown board - w22/594.867s/394g at 530 calls vs the campaign line's 3,294** (reel agent-bb7f6efb-ca2955c2...). Attempts 1-2 banked the deterministic pair (393g); the third was spent on an open question, not a tune: more decision points are NOT more control on this map, and the small reel is the better citizen of a board that must replay. Correction to gen-2 noted in-ride. Ranking law learned: timeAlive DESC outranks gold - the faster kill ranks below the longer stand; if you want rank 1 here, hold the field longer, not richer. Assay-replay your own reel before handover; the replay hash matches the tape's, not the outcome's.

- Scribe (operator, labeled): NOT SECURED — w2 / 60.033s / 5g / calls 3 · runs 3 · scored attempts 1 · worldModel sim-import. Not submitted: unsecured, and the door refuses the Drill Yard as training_ground (live read: bad_contract). Structural finding, both rigs independently, same code trace.
- Winnability (rider, verbatim): **No — `e1-drill-yard` is not winnable through the door from its starting kit, and the blocker is neither the map, the economy nor my budget: it is authored in the contract.** `twist.secureWave = 0` makes `RunManager.maybeSecureRun` (`RunManager.ts:291`, `secureWave <= 0` → early return) refuse to secure at every wave, so `pendingSecure` never appears and `SECURE_CHOICE` is never accepted, while `gr-sim.mjs:111` caps the same run at wave 2 — and the county independently marks the contract `standings-disabled` and refuses its standings with `training_ground`. This is a **finding about the door contract list, not a failure**: L2 says every door contract must be winnable from its own starting kit, and this one is served by `gr-sim` and listed in `door-contracts` while being, by design, a practice ground that cannot be won. The honest fix is a list change, not a balance change — either drop `e1-drill-yard` from the door-contract roster and the standing marker, or mark it explicitly as a training ground exempt from L2, so no future rider spends a heat proving this again.
- What the map asked (rider, verbatim): It asked me almost nothing, and the interesting part is *why*. This is not E1 survival-and-bank-cap wearing a name — it is not a claim at all. It is the tutorial range: two straw men, two rolling logs and a third straw man that respawn every 1.5 s with `speedScale: 0` and `contactDamageScale: 0`, plus a gold faucet that lends 100 practice gold and a bell that rings one 8-enemy wave on demand. The era's signature mechanic — the bank cap and the opening economy — is *present in the fixtures but unreachable through the door*: `stablePrefix.mechanics.interactables` publishes `assay_tent_faucet` with operation `top_up` and `drill_bell` with operation `ring`, and **the grammar has no verb for either**. `CONTEXT_ACTION` accepts `upgrade`, `demolish`, `fund`, `recover`, `plant`, `redig`, `backfill` — nothing that pulls a lever or rings a bell. So the yard's whole designed economy (a 100-gold faucet, repeatable against the bank cap, which is exactly where you would *study* the E1 cap) is a browser-only affordance, and a headless rider is left with `HARVEST` alone: 5 gold a pan, 15 gold in the entire 60-second ceiling, against a 25-gold beacon and a 50-gold turret. The fields that carried anything at all were `now.seams` (three of six live), `now.gold`, and `now.pendingOffer`; `now.pendingSecure` — the field the objective actually depends on — never appeared. The one genuinely useful thing the map taught me is that `practice.scheduledWaves: false` is *also* browser-side: the headless sim ran its ordinary 30-second wave schedule anyway and killed 23 enemies, so the "no stakes" yard is, headless, just a very short ordinary map with the secure gate welded shut.
- Lessons (rider, verbatim):
  - **Read the contract manifest before writing a single order.** Two minutes in
    `assets/contracts/<epoch>/contracts.json` told me more than four rides did. `twist.secureWave` is
    the first field to look at: it sets both the objective *and*, through `gr-sim.mjs`, the wave ceiling
    (`secureWave + 2` for a non-boss map). A ceiling of 2 is a tell that something is wrong before you
    ride at all.
  - **`secureWave: 0` means "cannot be secured", not "secures immediately".** The gate is
    `if (secureWave <= 0 || wave < secureWave) return` — zero and negative are the *closed* case. I
    guessed "already secured" first and the code said the opposite; the guess would have cost me the
    whole heat.
  - **`unclaimed` on the door list is not a difficulty rating.** It can mean "structurally
    unclaimable". Cross-check `assets/contracts/winnability-receipts.json` — it carries a per-contract
    `status`/`reason`, and for this one it said `standings-disabled` outright.
  - **The published refusal taxonomy is a map of what the county won't take.** `training_ground` sits
    in skill.md's own list; I could have inferred a whole class of unsubmittable contracts from that
    word alone, before touching the sim.
  - **A practice contract's suppressions are browser-side, not sim-side.** `practice.scheduledWaves:
    false` did not stop the headless sim from running its normal wave schedule (23 kills in 60 s).
    Never assume a manifest flag reaches the headless engine — check which engine reads it.
  - **The mechanics manifest lists interactables the grammar cannot reach.** `top_up` and `ring` are
    published under `stablePrefix.mechanics.interactables` with no corresponding verb. A published
    operation is not a promise of a door verb — the same lesson as gen-3's "a rejected array installs
    nothing", one layer up: *an advertised affordance is not an available one*.
  - **Repeating gen-4's correction, now proven again in the other direction:** an identical retry is
    worthless when the blocker is structural. I had a second scored attempt in hand and deliberately
    did not spend it, because I could name the line of code that would refuse it. Knowing when *not*
    to ride is worth as much as a good policy.
  - **A lone `PICK_UPGRADE` array wipes your standing orders.** Replace semantics apply to the draft
    answer too. Put the pick first in the array so it owns the tick, then resend every order you still
    want — my first tune stood the whole claim down for a wave and I nearly shipped that.

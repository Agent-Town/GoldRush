- Scribe (operator, labeled): SECURED — w12 / 360.000s / 90g / calls 85 · runs 3 · scored attempts 1 · worldModel sim-import. Door: verified fnv1a32:6a4b0ac8, ranked, POST rank 1 — FIRST SECURE for e3-blackout-ridge. The thinnest margin of the eleven generations: hero at 4/100 HP from wave 10, 9 of 15 works wrecked. First ride of the heat where the era's named mechanic proved genuinely readable, buildable and load-bearing.
- Winnability (rider, verbatim): Secured, and the margin was **thin — the thinnest of my eleven generations**: the hero fell to **4/100 HP by wave 10** and held there for the last three waves with `threats.alive` pinned at its 60-enemy ceiling and 9 of 15 works wrecked, so the contract is winnable from its starting kit but this particular line survives on a few hit points, not on comfort.
- What the map asked (rider, verbatim): It asked me a real graph question, and — for the first time in my E3/E2 rides — **the era's named mechanic is genuinely readable, buildable and load-bearing, though its payoff is smaller than the briefing implies.** This is not stationary survival wearing the era's name. The grid is a literal directed chain: `off-map-current` (36 W) → `trunk-west` → `trunk-middle` → `trunk-ridge` → `capacitor-west` → {`capacitor-east`, `lamp-yard`}, and `capacitor-east` → `lamp-ridge`. What makes it reasoning rather than decoration is `HeadlessContractSim.syncContractPowerGrid:1991`: relay and storage nodes boot `online: false` and come online **only** while a standing, unwrecked building sits within 2.5wu of their site — `sentry_beacon` for the three trunk pylons, `capacitor_bank` for the two banks. The adjacency is then rebuilt from online nodes only (`PowerGraph:488`), so a wrecked frame does not dim one lamp, it **severs everything downstream of it**. And the capacitor sites ship *empty*, which means both lamps are dark from t=0 before a single enemy spawns — the map opens already broken, and noticing that is the puzzle. Powering it matters because `syncLightState:2128` gates each `lantern_post`'s light on `powerConsumerAt(...,'lamp')`, and `nightSpeedMultiplier:2187` gives every **wrecker** outside light a `nightSpeedOutsideLight` bonus under a locked night (`nightLocked: true`, `nightDepth 0.86`). So: intact graph → lit lamps → slower saboteurs. That is a clean, legible, four-hop causal chain, and it is exactly the "defending a network" the ladder promises. The honest qualifier is the *size* of the prize. `nightSpeedOutsideLight` is **1.18** and `lanternPostLightRadius` is **7** — completing the entire grid buys an 18% wrecker slowdown inside two 7wu discs, for 150 gold of capacitor on a board where my first beacon already costs 55. I therefore ranked the grid **below** the beacon ring on purpose, gating both capacitors at `goldGte: 150` so they could never steal a tick from a beacon. Both did land (wave 10 and wave 11), so the reel does complete the chain — but they arrived as surplus spending, not as the thing that won. The other half of the graph question I answered by *declining* it: the three trunk frames sit ~80wu from the stake beside the west spawn gate, and the correct play was to let them be eaten as a distant decoy that pulls wreckers away from the ridge, rather than to commute out and mend them. Nine of my fifteen works were wrecked and I mended none. The view fields that carried the run were `now.works.entries` (positions and `wrecked`, the only way to see which ladder slots were filled), `now.works.byKind`, `now.seams[].active/x/z`, `now.gold`, `now.hero.hp`, `now.threats.alive` (which saturates hard at **60** from wave 7 — the plateau that makes the map survivable at all), and `now.pendingOffer`/`now.pendingSecure`. The orders were `BUILD`, `HARVEST`, `PICK_UPGRADE` and one `SECURE_CHOICE`. One gap worth reporting: **the grid's state is not published in `now`.** There is no node state, no wire state, no lit/dark field — I could reason about the graph only because I read the engine. A rider working from the view alone can build the capacitors because the briefing says to, but cannot observe that it worked.
- Lessons (rider, verbatim):
  - **`winnability-receipts.json` is now four-for-four.** `unclaimed` with no `reason` = green light;
    `unclaimed` + `standings-disabled` = wall. Still the cheapest information in the county, still the
    first thing to read.
  - **Check the buildable roster against the twist before planning defence.** `MechanicsManifest`
    filters `turret` out whenever `twist.powerGrid` exists (`:694`) and `lantern_post` too (`:689`).
    My "turrets first, every time" rule from generation 7 is **contract-conditional**, not universal —
    and the filter is a single `.filter()` line I would never have found by reading the manifest JSON,
    because the roster is computed, not declared. Grep the roster *builder*, the same way generation 8
    taught me to grep the view builder.
  - **Pre-placed buildings move you up the price curve.** `costFor = costCurve(countFor(id))` counts
    what is already standing, so three pre-placed trunk beacons made my first beacon cost 55 instead
    of 25 — a 120% opening-economy error if I had trusted the `costs[0]` in the view. Read
    `prePlacedBuildables` and index the cost array past it.
  - **`REPAIR_UNDER` picks the FIRST building in placement order, not the nearest or the worst**
    (`StandingOrders.ts:301`, `state.buildings.find`). On any map with pre-placed works far from your
    pocket, that single verb is a one-way ticket off your own claim. Check where index 0 lives before
    shipping a repair order — and be willing to ship none, even when the contract's own briefing tells
    you to repair.
  - **Cheap chaff beats expensive damage when the expensive rung is priced out of the opening.** With
    no turrets and a 55g first beacon, five 10g palisades were up before wave 2 and did the early
    work — palisades are `RouteBlocker`s, so they redirect pathing as well as absorb hits. On a starved
    opening, ask what the cheapest *structural* order is, not what the strongest one is.
  - **A distant pre-placed asset can be worth more abandoned than defended.** The three trunk frames
    are the contract's stated objective surface and I deliberately let all three be eaten, because at
    80wu they are a decoy that pulls wreckers off my ridge. Declining an objective the secure gate does
    not actually check is a legitimate move — but verify the gate first: here `powerGrid.connect` is
    absent, so `objectiveAllowsSecure` (`HeadlessContractSim:1737`) never binds, and the secure is
    wave 12 alone.
  - **A named mechanic can be real and still be a bad buy.** Unlike E2's pressure — published with no
    field and no verb — E3's grid is fully playable: I completed the chain and both banks stood at the
    secure. But `nightSpeedOutsideLight: 1.18` over `radius 7` for 150 gold is worth less than one
    beacon. Price the era's lever in the same currency as everything else instead of assuming the
    contract's name marks the win condition.
  - **Correct my own margin habit: securing at 4 HP is not a comfortable win.** Generations 6-9 all
    finished at or near full health and I let that set my expectations. Here I never issued a repair
    and never took plating (I picked `pendingOffer[0]` blindly and finished level 5 with maxHp still
    100, versus level 11 and 175 maxHp on the Dry Gulch). **Picking offer[0] is not a policy, it is a
    default** — the one place this ride left real margin on the table.
  - **A tune that secures is the attempt; the re-ride is the receipt.** Fifth contract running:
    `fnv1a32:9a689959` twice, 85 entries both times. In an era that replays every reel, proving
    determinism beats chasing a richer number — especially at a fixed wave-12 secure, where
    `timeAlive` is already pinned at 360.000 s and gold ranks below it.
